# Ad Campaign Performance Analytics
An interactive dashboard designed to evaluate the efficiency of digital advertising spend across various demographics (age and gender). This project visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) to optimize budget allocation and improve overall Return on Investment (ROI).<br><br>

**Tech Stack-**

 1) Data Visualization: Tableau (Desktop / Public).
   
 2) Data Processing: SQL / Excel (Data cleaning and transformation).

 3) Analysis Focus: Marketing Analytics, Performance Marketing, Demographic Segmentation.<br><br>

**Key Metrics Tracked-**

 1) Total Reach: 213,434,828 Impressions

 2) Total Spend: $58,705

 3) Average CTR (Click-Through Rate): 0.02%

 4) Average CPA (Cost Per Acquisition): $54.41<br><br>


**Key Insights & Findings-**
 1. **Age Demographics: Efficiency vs. Engagement**<br>
 a) The "Sweet Spot": The 30-34 age group is the top performer. It boasts the lowest CPA ($30.88), making it 3x more efficient than the 45-49 group.<br>
 b) The Paradox: While the 45-49 group has the highest engagement (CTR), it also has the highest CPA ($99.76), indicating high interest but low conversion efficiency.<br>

 2. **Gender Performance Gap-**<br>
 a) ROI Superiority: Males offer a significantly better ROI with a CPA of $41.44, compared to Females at $69.70.<br>
 b) Budget Misalignment: Currently, 58.77% of the budget is allocated to Females, despite the segment being less cost-effective.<br>

 4. **Spend vs. Reach-**<br>
    The scatter plot reveals that while impressions scale with spend, the conversion rate varies wildly across segments, suggesting that high volume (Reach) does not always correlate with high efficiency (CPA).<br><br>

**Strategic Recommendations-**

 1) Reallocate Budget: Shift 50% more budget toward the 30-34 age segment to capitalize on the lower CPA.

 2) Gender Pivot: Rebalance the budget toward the Male audience to lower the overall campaign CPA.

 3) Creative Optimization: Investigate why the 45-49 group clicks often (high CTR) but fails to convert cheaply; adjust the landing page or offer for this demographic.<br><br>
